# Abstract

Learning based approaches for depth perception are limited by the availability of clean training data. 
This has led to the utilization of view synthesis as an indirect objective for learning depth estimation using efficient data acquisition procedures. 
Nonetheless, most research focuses on pinhole based monocular vision, with scarce works presenting results for omnidirectional input.
In this work, we explore spherical view synthesis for learning monocular 360<sup>o</sup> depth in a self-supervised manner and demonstrate its feasibility.
Under a purely geometrically derived formulation we present results for horizontal and vertical baselines, as well as for the trinocular case.
Further, we show how to better exploit the expressiveness of traditional CNNs when applied to the equirectangular domain in an efficient manner.
Finally, given the availability of ground truth depth data, our work is uniquely positioned to compare view synthesis against direct supervision in a consistent and fair manner.
The results indicate that alternative research directions might be better suited to enable higher quality depth perception.
Our data, models and code are publicly available at [our project page](https://vcl3d.github.io/SphericalViewSynthesis/).

# Spherical Disparity
We derive our spherical disparity model under a purely geometrical formulation.
Spherical stereo comprises two spherical viewpoints that image their surroundings in their local spherical coordinate system.
These are related via their 3D displacement (_i.e._ `baseline`), defined in a global Cartesian coordinate system.

</p>

By taking the analytical partial derivatives of the Cartesian to spherical conversion equations, a formulation of spherical angular disparity in terms of the radius (_i.e._ `depth`) and the `baseline` is made.

</p>

Considering a horizontal (red, &#x1F534;) stereo setup (_i.e._ displacement only along the `x` axis) as well as a vertical (blue, &#x1F535;) stereo setup (_i.e._ displacement only along the `y` axis) it is apparent that the former includes both longitudinal as well as latitudinal angular displacements, while the latter one only includes latitudinal, as also illustrated in the following figures.

![Spherical Angular Disparity for 2 Vertically Displaced Viewpoints](./assets/images/vertical_disparity.png)

As a result, we can use this depth derived disparity formulation to self-supervise spherical depth estimation. Crucially, for the horizontal case, this is only possible using depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) instead of inverse warping, as it helps in overcoming the irregular remappings of stereo spherical imaging. We rely on a recently presented differentiable DIRB scheme (__[3]__), and additionally employ spherical weighting as an attention mechanism to address inconsistent gradient flows at the singularities. Finally, we also experiment with trinocular stereo placements and with infusing spherical spatial knowledge into the network implicity through the use of Coordinate Convolutions (__[4]__).
